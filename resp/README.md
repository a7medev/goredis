# RESP

RESP stands for Redis Serialization Protocol. It is a simple protocol that Redis uses to communicate with clients. The protocol is text-based and is designed to be simple to parse and generate.

You can read more about the protocol [here](https://redis.io/topics/protocol).

The `resp` package contains the code for parsing and encoding RESP.
